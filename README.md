This is just a demo application for speedcubing, a passion of mine.

This web app uses Python, Django, SQLite, JS, HTML, CSS, and an external library for the scramble. 
It allows the user to register, log in, save solves, see averages, time solves, get scrambles for 3x3, have a history of solve times, etc.
