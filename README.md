<h1>RubikTimer</h1>
A responsive demo web application I made of a speedcubing timer, a passion of mine. Main project while studying CS50W.

<h2>Description</h2>
This web app uses Python, Django, SQLite, JS, HTML, CSS, and an external library for the scramble. 
It allows the user to register, log in, save solves, see averages, time solves, get official scrambles for 3x3, have a history of solve times, etc.
